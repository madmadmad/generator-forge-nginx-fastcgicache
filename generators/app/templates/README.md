# Installation

1. Copy the command below to setup the necessary folders to house your FastCGI cache files.
2. Copy the cronjob task into your Scheduler tab. This ensures that the necessary cache folders are writeable when the server is restarted.
3. Copy the generate `nginx.conf` file into your Forge site's `nginx configuration` file.  

## Initial Setup Command

SSH into your server and run the following command.

⚠️ **Note:** You will need your server's sudo password ready to run this.

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/run/nginx-cache/<%= config.cacheKey %> ; sudo chown -R forge /var/run/nginx-cache ; sudo chgrp -R forge /var/run/nginx-cache
```

## Cronjob Setup

Copy the script from above into your Scheduler tab. Set the cronjob user as `root` and set the schedule to run on Reboot.

## Installing the Configuration file

Copy the generated `nginx.conf` file into your site's Nginx Configuration by going to your site in Forge, scroll to the bottom, and select the "Files" button. There will be an option to access your nginx configuration file that was generated by Forge.

⚠️ **Note:** Please save a copy of your existing / working nginx file as an issue with the newly generated configuration file can bring your site down immediately.
